The problems solved during this course was in developing a program and creating functional software. Project two made a program that built a list of data from inserted files. This was approached by understanding the resource material and time spent tinkering with the code. During roadblocks I would often take some time away and come back refreshed, thinking about what is wrong or next. This helps me stay out of loops and on task. This class helped me with my java application class, in that it has a menu with various options and selections. It's list functioned very particularly for the purpose of the app but still. Yes considering effective and efficient code is a key strategy in maintaining good code.
